Hello,

This is Nikhil, a second year at GT version of Nikhil.

The version of Nikhil who wrote this paper did not nearly credit Victor Snaith enough for his work on the representations of the 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and representations of the moves on a cube as a permutation matrix, which I heavily used in my paper. Although I did credit him at the bottom of the paper, to be honest, his name should be plastered everywhere, and credited for guiding my own understanding of Group Theory being applied to the cube. 

Finally, rest in Peace to Victor Snaith, and thank you for your contributions to mathematics.
